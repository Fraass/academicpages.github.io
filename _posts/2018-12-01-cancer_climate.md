My dad is a radiation physicist who works on cancer treatment. I'm a climate scientist who uses a fossil group that can be used to find oil reserves. There's an interesting duality to both those types of science, both can be used for positive or negative. [This post](http://cabot-institute.blogspot.com/2018/12/cancer-and-climate-change.html) for the Cabot Institute explores that duality.
