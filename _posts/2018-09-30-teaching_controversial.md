This post has been used in two places, [Time Scavengers](https://timescavengers.blog/2018/09/30/teaching-controversial-subjects-in-a-conservative-area/) and [Cabot](http://cabot-institute.blogspot.com/2018/11/teaching-controversial-subjects-in.html). It describes trying to cover climate change and evolution in a religious and politically conservative state, Texas. Both subjects caused obvious friction in the course. I frequently asked the students to fill out note cards with anonymous questions or feedback, and the friction was apparent. In this post I describe both how standard teaching won't work, and how to (in my opinion) mix into a combination of science communication and typical information-transfer teaching. Both exams and my teaching scores suggest this was working, at least somewhat, so I hope the post is helpful for folks.
