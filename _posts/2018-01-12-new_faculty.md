Ever want to know what it's like to have a severe case of burnout? Just read [this](https://timescavengers.blog/2018/01/12/what-its-like-to-be-a-new-faculty-member/). It's a description of what my first year as a Visiting Assistant Professor was like. I wrote it in airports on the way back to and from a job interview, during my students finals week. It's pretty unfiltered description of what it was like.
