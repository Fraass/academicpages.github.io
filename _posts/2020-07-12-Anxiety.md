I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder about a decade ago. I have had my ups and downs with them, though they're certainly always with me. I  went through a period of abnormally high anxiety, culminating in seeking help from therapists again. I wrote [this post](https://timescavengers.blog/2020/06/24/anxiety-in-academia/) as a way to begin processing both the past and current situation as it is filtered through the disorders. It also has a few suggestions at the end about what to do (Seek help!) if you too struggle with these disorders.
