I wrote a paper with a frequently collaborator [Chris Lowery](https://chrislowerymicropaleo.weebly.com/) about how oxygen isotopes work in planktic foraminifera. [This post](https://timescavengers.blog/2017/07/12/how-well-do-stable-isotopes-really-work/) was explaining how it works for a general audience.
