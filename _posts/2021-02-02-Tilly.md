[A description](https://timescavengers.blog/2021/01/20/building-and-establishing-the-tilly-edinger-travel-grant/) of how we set up a fund to support students and avocational scientists attending science meetings. Importantly, this grant is set up to act _during_ registration, rather than as a reimbursement, like one would get from a University. The problems with that are fairly obvious!
