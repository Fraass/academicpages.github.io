I and my students work to answer key questions about the functioning of the Earth system. We primarily use planktic foraminifera and the marine sediment record to examine how plankton evolve in reaction to biotic and/or abiotic forces. This frequently involves looking at the various climate and oceanographic events that happen within the Cenozoic and Cretaceous.

Paleobiology and Paleoceanography
-----
We are animated by welding modern paleobiological techniques to paleoceanographic questions, and visa versa. This means that students in my group work with a variety of methods; computational, taxonomic, proxy, and and so on. We're involved with a number of different projects from large database efforts, to climate changes at the Oligocene Miocene boundary, to bettering conditions for early career researchers.
