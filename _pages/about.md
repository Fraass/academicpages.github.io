I and my students work to answer key questions about the functioning of the Earth system. We primarily use planktic foraminifera and the marine sediment record to examine how plankton evolve in reaction to biotic and/or abiotic forces. This frequently involves looking at the various climate and oceanographic events that happen within the Cenozoic and Cretaceous.

Paleobiology and Paleoceanography
-----
We are animated by welding modern paleobiological techniques to paleoceanographic questions, and visa versa. This means that students in my group work with a variety of methods; computational, taxonomic, proxy, and and so on. We're involved with a number of different projects from large database efforts, to climate changes at the Oligocene Miocene boundary, to bettering conditions for early career researchers.

The goal of eODP is to make over five decades of scientific ocean drilling data discoverable and easily visualized for researchers and non-scientists. eODP will start as a comprehensive scientific ocean drilling stratigraphy and fossil occurrence system nestled in two highly successful databases: [Paleobiology Database](paleobiodb.org) (PBDB; ~1.5 million fossil occurrences, alongside taxonomy and associated information), and [Macrostrat](macrostrat.org) (age models, >35,000 surface and subsurface rock units). There are also funds to guide and develop this system as a community-driven resource, through multiple workshops and other community involvement.

We plan to use this to develop further research, and it will be a key aspect of my work moving forward. If you are interested in becoming involved, please let me know. 

eODP is a collaborative effort by myself, [Jocelyn Sessa](https://drexel.edu/coas/faculty-research/faculty-directory/Jocelyn-Sessa/), [Leah LeVay](https://iodp.tamu.edu/staffdir/indiv/levay/), and [Shanan Peters](http://strata.geology.wisc.edu/), funded by NSF's [EarthCube](https://www.earthcube.org/) program.

If you are interested in a PhD or MSc, I am taking students at the University of Victoria starting in 2021. Please get in contact!
