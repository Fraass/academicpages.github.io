My lab works to answer key questions about the functioning of the Earth system. We primarily use planktic foraminifera to examine how they react to biotic and/or abiotic forces. This includes their reaction to climate change. 

Paleobiology and Paleoceanography
======
We are animated by attempting to weld modern paleobiological techniques to paleoceanographic questions, and visa versa. This means that students in my group work with a variety of methods; computational, taxonomic, proxy, and and so on.

If you are interested in a PhD or MSc, I am taking students starting in 2021. Please get in contact!

eODP
======
I lead a multi-institutional effort to make scientific ocean drilling data ([IODP] (http://www.iodp.org/)) more operable and discoverable. In the simplest possible terms, we are taking moving stratigraphic data (age models, splices, core description) to [Macrostrat] (https://macrostrat.org/) and moving microfossil occurrence data to the [Paleobiology Database] (https://paleobiodb.org/#/). We are hosting a variety of workshops to discuss best practices for doing this process as well as what next steps can be takinng to make a scientific drilling data more analysis ready. 

The goal here is to make a framework to connect the lithosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere. Marine rocks and microfossils are the ideal setting for that work, by combining the examination of marine rocks, microfossils, and past climates. It'll let us answer all sorts of big, interesting questions with the most robust fossil and sediment record. How do pelagic species actually speciate? Geographic seperation is difficult to imagine in the marine realm, so what mechanism works? How linked are the biotic marine and terrestrial sedimentation records? Do the extinction of pelagic species drive decreases in carbonate flux, as we might expect? 

Paleoceanography
======
As well as those integrative questions, the group is interested in proxy-based analysis of IODP cores. This work includes shipboard biostratigraphy, like on [IODP Exp. 340](http://publications.iodp.org/proceedings/340/340toc.htm), post-cruise refinements using [higher-resolution biostratigraphy and astrochronology](http://www.micropress.org/microaccess/stratigraphy/issue-328/article-1993), to larger [updates of multiple sites](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/cushmanfoundation/jfr/article-abstract/49/4/357/574532/Precision-in-Biostratigraphy-Evidence-For-a?redirectedFrom=fulltext), or paleoclimatic proxy work. Biostratigraphy is at its best when it's a tool to answer other questions, so we're either working to improve important fossil calibrations of key boundaries, working on sedimentological phenomina with climate impacts, or setting up future proxy work. 

I also dabble in improving our understanding of proxy systems. [FIRM](https://github.com/Fraass/FIRM) ([paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016PA003035)) is an example, it allows for estimation of the number of planktic foram tests it takes to get a robust oxygen isotope value.
