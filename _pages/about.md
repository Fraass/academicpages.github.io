My students and I work to answer key questions about the functioning of the Earth system. We primarily use planktic foraminifera and the marine sediment record to examine how plankton evolve in reaction to biotic and/or abiotic forces. This frequently involves looking at the various climate and oceanographic events within the Cenozoic and Cretaceous.

Paleobiology and Paleoceanography
-----
We are animated by using paleobiology to answer paleoceanographic questions, and vice versa. This means that students in my group work with a variety of methods: computational, taxonomic, proxy, and and so on. We're involved with a number of different projects from large database efforts, to climate changes at the Oligocene Miocene boundary, to the evolution of planktic foraminifera at both the macro- and microevolutionary scale, to bettering conditions for early career researchers. 

If you are interested in a PhD or MSc, I will be taking students at the University of Victoria starting in 2021. Please get in contact!

The goal of eODP is to make over five decades of scientific ocean drilling data discoverable and easily visualized for researchers and non-scientists. eODP will start as a comprehensive scientific ocean drilling stratigraphy and fossil occurrence system nestled in two highly successful databases: [Paleobiology Database](paleobiodb.org) (PBDB; ~1.5 million fossil occurrences, alongside taxonomy and associated information), and [Macrostrat](macrostrat.org) (age models, >35,000 surface and subsurface rock units). There are also funds to guide and develop this system as a community-driven resource, through multiple workshops and other community involvement. If you are interested in becoming involved, please let me know. 

I plan to use this new system to investigate how plankton ecology affects pelagic carbonate production. Ecological (e.g., abundance, geographic range) or evolutionary (e.g., extinction) changes in the plankton are generally not included when discussing historical Calcite Compensation Depth (CCD) fluctuations, despite evidence that local CaCO<sub>3</sub> flux impacts the CCD. Climate and biogeochemical models generally ignore key aspects of pelagic microorganisms: their evolution, ecology, abundances, productivity or flux, or even the size of their shells or liths (the tiny plates of a calcareous nannofossil). How pelagic ecosystems react to changes in climate is a clear weakness in our understanding, as called out by past IPCC reports.

eODP is a collaborative effort by myself, [Jocelyn Sessa](https://drexel.edu/coas/faculty-research/faculty-directory/Jocelyn-Sessa/), [Leah LeVay](https://iodp.tamu.edu/staffdir/indiv/levay/), and [Shanan Peters](http://strata.geology.wisc.edu/), funded by NSF's [EarthCube](https://www.earthcube.org/) program.
